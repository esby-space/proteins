# Protein Modeling Resources

## Overview

Protein modeling can already be a difficult topic to understand, even more so when all the software doesn't work with each other...
Last year protein modeling students made a video explaining the software, and so we wanted to follow up on that!
There were a lot of errors we encountered during this project, so hopefully this website can smooth those over and make the process a bit more enjoyable!

## Future Plans

### Software

-   Integrate the Haddock 2.4 renumbering software into an easy to use interface
-   Create a program to make Clustal Omega alignment files more easy to search through
-   Create a program to automatically sort through multiple bindings and judge the similarity of the bonds from PDBe Pisa results (i have no clue how to do this one)

### Tutorials

-   Link to the video explaining all the different programs
-   Explain what the different file formats are and when they are useful
-   Go through the possible errors from the different program and common fixes
