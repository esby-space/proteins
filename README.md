# Protein Modeling Resources

## Overview

Protein modeling can already be a difficult topic to understand, even more so when all the software doesn't work with each other...
Last year protein modeling students made a video explaining the software, and so we wanted to follow up on that!
There were a lot of errors we encountered during this project, so hopefully this website can smooth those over and make the process a bit more enjoyable!
