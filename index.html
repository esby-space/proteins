            <h3>Fixing Errors with Haddock 2.4</h3>
            <p>Ok, so after days of scrolling you've finally found the right PDB files with a good resolution!
                Congratulations! You put them into Haddock 2.4 for testing and... <strong>there's an error</strong>.
                What does this mean? What should I do? Why don't you like me Haddock?! Here are some tips to amend your
                relations with the Haddock Gods! <a href="https://www.bonvinlab.org/software/bpg/">Make sure to visit
                    the Haddock 2.4 Best Practice Guides for better checking!</a></p>

                <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">

                    <span class="sr-only">Error: </span>
                    Error in PDB file.<br>Your PDB contains multiple chains with overlapping numbering: A14 - B14
                    Consider selecting a chain or splitting your PDB<br>
                </div>
                <p>This error can be caused because your PDB file either has multiple protein in it, or because it is
                    not numbered properly. To fix the first issue, open the file in ChimeraX to see if you have more
                    than one protein, then seperate them out into seperate PDB files in a text editor. For the second
                    issue, put the file into the tool above and renumber it.</p>

                    would like to supply multiple conformations, please create an ensemble.<br><br>
                </div>
                <p>PDB files can contain mulitple variations of one residue. Haddock is saying it doesn't know which
                    variation to chose. Open the file up in a text editor and scroll down to the problematic residue.
                    You will notice that some atoms of that residue have an extra character (normally "A" or "B") before
                    the residue type that denote the different variations. Delete the extra variations and remove "A" to
                    make that line look like the rest of them. (Make sure to make a backup before doing this!)</p>

                <p>Ions in PDB files should be annotated with their necessary charge, but sometimes they're not. The

                    formatted with record HETATM instead?<br><br>
                </div>
                <p>Some PDB files incorrectly label their atoms. For example, some atoms are part of residues, others
                    are sugars, and so on. In this case, NAG refers to a 2-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranose, a
                    Carbohydrate. But Haddock is reading this as if it were a residue and is confused. <a
                        href="https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/haddock2.4/library">Here is the library of all supported
                        modified residues.</a> Open the PDB File in a text editor and CTRL (CMD) + F to find the issue
                    (in this case, search for "NAG"). If the start of those lines begins with "ATOM", replace it with
                    "HETATM" to indicate that those atoms are not residues. Make sure to preserve the structure of the
                    document! TIP: select all problematic lines by SHIFT + CLCIKING them, copy and paste them into a new
                    document, find and replace all instances of "ATOM" with "HETATM" (add or remove space to preserve
                    structure), select all, copy again, go back to original document, and paste to overide the old
                    lines.</p>
